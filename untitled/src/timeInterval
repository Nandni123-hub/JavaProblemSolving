Given a set of time intervals in any order, our task is to merge all overlapping intervals into one and output the result which should have only mutually exclusive intervals.
Example:

Input: Intervals = {{1,3},,{6,8},{2,4}{9,10}} Output: {{1, 4}, {6, 8}, {9, 10}} 
Input: Intervals = {{6,8},{1,9},{2,4},{4,7}} Output: {{1, 9}}
